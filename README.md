# Shredder - Unshredder

As a response to Instagram Engineering Challenge:
https://engineering.instagram.com/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder-7ef3f7323ab1#.dsmknhvq6

<h2>Note: Requires OpenCV 2.4 for Python 2.7.12</h2>
<h2>OS used: Max OS X 10.11.6</h2>

The script intelligently detects shred width from supplied shredded image. No assumptions and hardcodings!
Unshredder uses a simple SSD match followed by path tracing to find the best fit to jigsaw puzzle.
